Implements a hybrid transformer model to predict the impact of sgRNA on the cellular fitness of E. coli MG1655. This model considers the sequence of the 20 upstream nucleotides and 
the 3-nt protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), along with additional non-sequence features such as guide orientation, genome positioning, coding strand, and gene essentiality.
